LibreWMI - Free WMI (World Manufacturers Identifiers)

There is about 33000 allocated WMI's and this is an attempt to expose them as data items, to be transformed into usable structures.



The source of this data is somewhat dated but the nature of WMI's is that once they are allocated, they live on for years and do not change much. As  WMI's indicate a global use, they are issued for anything that moves on wheels, bands or floats on water even and are manufactured in greater numbers than 500 units per year.



The data as it currently sits are missing details and has not been transformed into usable structures, yet. Some entries/issues might be missing all together and some needs translations to English.
